The substitute word "amount" is a good fit in the given context as it also refers to a sum of money, similar to the target word "total". However, the word "total" also implies the result of an addition or accumulation of different amounts, which is crucial in this context as it's about the invoices for three different months. The substitute word "amount" doesn't convey this nuance as strongly, hence the score of 80 instead of a perfect 100.
The substitute word 'sum' is quite fitting in the given context as it can be used to refer to the total amount of money. Both 'total' and 'sum' are nouns that are commonly used in the context of accounting and finance to denote the aggregate amount. Therefore, the score of 80 is justified as 'sum' can be a good substitute for 'total' in this context. However, it's not a perfect 100 because 'total' is a more common term to use in this context to refer to the final amount of money, especially when referring to invoices and payments. 'Sum' might imply a process of adding up, which is slightly less fitting in this context than 'total'.
The substitute "sum total" does fit into the context as it can be used to refer to the total amount of something. However, it is not as natural or as common of a usage as the word "total" in this context. The phrase "sum total" is often used in more formal or mathematical contexts, and may seem redundant or overly formal in everyday conversation or in this business context. Therefore, I gave it a score of 60, as it is somewhat suitable but not the ideal substitute.
The substitute word "price" can be used in place of "total" in this context, but it does not accurately convey the same meaning. The word "total" refers to the sum of all the amounts, while "price" generally refers to the cost of a single item or service. In this context, "price" could be interpreted as the cost of the invoices for each individual month, which is not the intended meaning. Therefore, the score is 60 because "price" is a somewhat relevant substitution, but it does not fully capture the meaning of "total" in this context.
The substitute word "balance" can be used in a financial context to represent the amount of money. However, in the given context, the word "total" is used to refer to the sum of all the amounts for the three months. While "balance" could vaguely imply the same, it is not as precise as "total" because balance usually refers to an amount left over after deductions, not a sum of amounts. Therefore, the score is 60, indicating that while the substitute word "balance" can fit in the context, it is not the most accurate replacement for "total".
The substitute word 'gross' can be used in the context, but it may not convey the exact meaning as 'total'. The term 'gross' often refers to the total amount of something before deductions, so it could imply that there may be further deductions from the amount of $3,615,910.62. This may not be what the original sentence is implying as 'total' often refers to the final or complete sum. Therefore, while 'gross' could somewhat fit in the context, it may slightly alter the meaning, hence the score of 60.
The substitute word "figure" is somewhat contextually relevant to the target word "total" in this context. Both words can be used to refer to a numerical value or sum, which is why it has been given a moderate score of 50. However, "figure" is not as precise as "total" in this context, as "total" directly implies the sum of all amounts, while "figure" could also refer to a single amount. Therefore, while the word "figure" could potentially work in this context, it does not convey the meaning as accurately as the target word "total".
The substitute word 'cost' is somewhat relevant in the given context. The context is about the completion of invoices for certain months and the amount owed to Pasadena, which can be considered as a 'cost'. However, the target word 'total' is more specific to the context, referring to the cumulative amount for the specified months. The substitute word 'cost' lacks this specificity, hence it only gets a score of 50. It fits the context but doesn't convey the exact meaning as 'total' does.
The substitute "full amount" is partially correct in this context, which is why it received a score of 40. The word "total" in the given context refers to the summation of the amounts owed for the months of April, May, and June. The phrase "full amount" can be interpreted as the complete sum that is owed, so it carries a similar meaning. However, "full amount" might also imply the entirety of a single payment, not necessarily a summation of several smaller amounts. Therefore, while it's not entirely out of place, it's not the most accurate substitution for "total" in this specific context.
The substitute word 'whole' is not entirely incorrect in this context, but it doesn't fit as well as the target word 'total'. The word 'total' is commonly used in financial contexts to refer to the sum of multiple amounts, as it is used here. On the other hand, 'whole' can also mean the sum of all parts, but it's not typically used in financial contexts. Instead, it's often used to refer to something that is complete or undivided. Therefore, while 'whole' could potentially work in this context, it's not the best fit, which is why I gave it a score of 30.
The substitute word "number" does not fully capture the meaning of the target word "total" in this context. While "total" suggests the final sum or aggregate of the amounts, "number" is more general and could refer to any numerical quantity, not necessarily a sum. However, it's not completely out of context as it still refers to a numerical entity. Therefore, a score of 30 seems reasonable as it is somewhat relevant but not the most accurate substitution.
The substitute word 'quantum' is a noun, just like the target word 'total'. However, 'quantum' is typically used in scientific contexts to refer to the smallest possible discrete unit of any physical property. In the context of the sentence, the word 'total' refers to the sum of the amounts owed for the months of April, May, and June. The word 'quantum' doesn't fit seamlessly into the context, as it doesn't convey the meaning of a sum or total amount. Therefore, I gave it a low score of 15 out of 100, indicating that it is not a very suitable substitute in this context.
The substitute word "aggregate" is not completely irrelevant, but it doesn't fit as well into this context as the target word "total". "Aggregate" is typically used in a more technical or statistical context, such as when summing up data points. In this context, where Kim is discussing invoices, "total" is a more common and suitable term. Therefore, I gave it a score of 10 out of 100. If the context were more technical or statistical, the score could be higher.
The substitute word "bill" is not an appropriate substitute for "total" in this context. While "total" refers to the complete sum of the amounts, "bill" refers to an amount of money owed for goods supplied or services rendered, presented on a printed or written statement of charges. Here, the context is about the sum of money that is owed for several months, not the statement of charges itself. Therefore, the score is low at 10. The substitute word "bill" changes the meaning of the sentence significantly, thus it is not a suitable replacement for "total".
The substitute word "all" does not fit in the context of the sentence. The target word "total" in this context refers to the sum of money owed to Pasadena. The word "all" cannot replace "total" as it does not convey the same meaning. "All" would imply every individual invoice or month, not the sum of the invoices. Therefore, the score is 0 because the substitute word is not contextually relevant.
The substitute word "entirety" does not fit in the given context. The word "total" in this context refers to the sum of amounts owed for each month, which is a numerical value. The word "entirety" generally refers to the whole of something in a non-numerical sense, making it unsuitable in this context. Therefore, I assigned a score of 0.
The substitute word "bulk" is not contextually relevant for the target word "total" in this sentence. Though "bulk" can refer to a large amount or majority of something, it does not convey the same meaning as "total" which refers to the whole amount in this context. "Bulk" also doesn't fit well in the sentence structure, making it sound unnatural. Therefore, it receives a score of 0.
The substitute word "flat out" is not contextually suitable for the target word "total" in this given context. The target word "total" in this context refers to the cumulative sum of the amounts owed for the months of April, May, and June. The phrase "flat out" is often used to mean "completely" or "directly", and it doesn't convey the same meaning as "total" in this context. Therefore, it is inappropriate as a substitute and I've given it a score of 0.
The substitute word 'final' doesn't fit well in the given context. The word 'total' in the context refers to the sum of the amounts owed for each month, whereas 'final' implies an end or conclusion, not a sum. Therefore, I gave it a score of 0.
The substitute word "body" is not appropriate in this context. The target word "total" refers to the sum amount of money owed to Pasadena for the months of April, May, and June. The substitute "body" does not carry the same meaning or convey the correct sense in this context. "Body" often refers to a physical entity, a group of individuals, or a main section of a text, none of which fit into the context here. Therefore, I gave it a score of 0.
The substitute word "jackpot" does not fit in the given context. The term "jackpot" is typically used in the context of gambling or winning a large sum of money. However, the context here is about business transactions and invoices, specifically the total amount owed. Therefore, "jackpot" is not a suitable substitute for "total" in this context, hence the score of 0.
The substitute word "tale" is not contextually relevant as a replacement for the target word "total" in this context. The context is about financial transactions and the word "total" is used to refer to the sum of the amounts mentioned. The word "tale", on the other hand, refers to a narrative or story, which is not applicable in this context. Therefore, I assigned a score of 0, indicating that the substitute word is not a suitable replacement for the target word in this context.
The substitute word 'totality' is not an appropriate replacement for 'total' in the given context. The word 'total' in the context refers to the sum of money owed for the three months, and 'totality' does not convey this meaning. 'Totality' refers to the whole of something or the state of being total, often used in a more abstract or philosophical sense, and not typically used to refer to a sum of money. Therefore, the score is 0 due to the lack of contextual relevance and the fact that the substitute word does not preserve the original meaning of the sentence.
The substitute word "worth" does not fit into the context appropriately. In this sentence, "total" refers to the sum of money that is owed to Pasadena for the months of April, May, and June. The word "worth" typically refers to the value of something, which is not the same as the total sum of money owed. Therefore, the score for this substitution is 0.
The substitute word "result" is not a suitable replacement for the target word "total" in this context. The term "total" in this context refers to the sum or whole amount of the invoices for the specified months. The word "result" implies an outcome or consequence, which doesn't fit in this context. Therefore, the score is 0.
The substitute word "allotment" is not appropriate in the given context. The term "allotment" generally refers to a portion or share of something that is given out or allocated. The target word "total" in this context refers to the sum or overall amount of money owed for the invoices of April, May, and June. Therefore, "allotment" does not convey the same meaning as "total" in this context, and hence the score of 0.
The substitute word 'quantity' does not fit well in the context of the sentence. The term 'total' refers to the sum of the amounts owed for the months of April, May, and June. The word 'quantity' typically refers to the amount or number of a material or immaterial thing not usually estimated by spatial measurement. In this context, it's more about the monetary sum, not the number or amount of invoices or months, which makes 'quantity' an inappropriate substitute for 'total'. Therefore, the score is 0.
The substitute word 'budget' does not fit into the context well. The term 'total' refers to the sum of amounts, while 'budget' refers to an estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time. In this context, 'total' is used to indicate the sum of money owed to Pasadena for each month. Substituting it with 'budget' would change the meaning of the sentence, implying that $3,615,910.62 is a planned amount, which is not the case. Therefore, I gave it a score of 0.
The substitute word "mass" does not fit contextually in the place of the target word "total." The term "total" is used to describe the sum of a series of numbers or amounts, in this case, the sum of the money owed to Pasadena for each month. On the other hand, "mass" is a term that typically refers to a large body of matter with no definite shape or to a large amount or number of something. It is not used to refer to the sum of a series of numbers or amounts. Therefore, the score is 0 as the substitute word does not maintain the original meaning of the sentence when replacing the target word.
The substitute word "the works" does not fit into the context because it changes the meaning of the sentence. The term "total" in this context refers to the sum of all the amounts owed for the months of April, May, and June. The term "the works" typically refers to everything that is available or the full range of something, and it does not imply any kind of sum or total. Therefore, it's inappropriate as a substitute in this context, hence the score of 0.
